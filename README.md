TransparenCSS
=============

Overhead Projector Simulator in CSS. Works best in Chrome and Safari.

Usage
=====

Clone and replace the content in the ```<script id="slides" type="text/template">``` section with slides of your own! It's just HTML, so go nuts.

Props
=====

Thanks to Bret Victor's ["The Future of Programming"](http://vimeo.com/71278954) for the dose of nostalgia for overhead projectors.
